{"name":"Tictactoe","body":"I challenged my ThoughtWorks sponsees to code Tictactoe with an AI that is better than random. The catch was they couldn't use any if/switch/ternaries. \r\n\r\nThis is my version. I used one while loop, one for loop, and a bunch of Guava filters.\r\n\r\nI did not test drive this because I wanted to be able to ask the question, \"What would tests look like for this code?\" and I wanted to see if I could write decent code without the TDD crutch (it turns out that using the crutch is worth it).\r\n\r\nThe questions I want my sponsees to answer are:\r\n* What would tests look like for this code?\r\n* What names could be improved?\r\n* What is ugly/hard to understand?\r\n* How fragile is this code?\r\n* How brittle is it?\r\n \r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
