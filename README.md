I challenged my ThoughtWorks sponsees to code Tictactoe with an AI that is better than random. The catch was they couldn't use any if/switch/ternaries. 

This is my version. I used one while loop, one for loop, and a bunch of Guava filters.

I did not test drive this because I wanted to be able to ask the question, "What would tests look like for this code?" and I wanted to see if I could write decent code without the TDD crutch (it turns out that using the crutch is worth it).

The questions I want my sponsees to answer are:
* What would tests look like for this code?
* What names could be improved?
* What is ugly/hard to understand?
* How fragile is this code?
* How brittle is it?
